# PhoenixForum

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * We assume there's a PostgreSQL database called "phoenix_forum_dev" with username and password "postgres" on localhost at port 5432 but you could change that on `config/dev.exs` if you want.
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup` (this will create the DB, migrate and seed it)
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
